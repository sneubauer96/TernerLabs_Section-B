This project uses regression analysis to examine how social connectedness influences evacuation behavior during disasters. Drawing on Facebook mobility data from Meta’s Data for Good program and its Disaster Movement Map series, the focus is on evacuation patterns during the 2020 Glass Fire in Napa and Sonoma counties.

The models estimate the relationship between region-to-region evacuation rates and measures of social connectedness, while controlling for bonding and bridging social capital, social vulnerability, and population characteristics. Interaction terms test how the effects of social connectedness vary by type of social capital which highlights how dense, inward-looking networks (bonding) may inhibit movement, while diverse, outward-facing networks (bridging) may facilitate it. This regression framework provides both predictive and explanatory insights into the social drivers of wildfire evacuation.

The code snippet here illustrates part of the modeling process. Building modular models was essential: I specified multiple sets of controls (five in total, with two shown here) and incrementally expanded the models to assess how variables influenced coefficients, statistical significance, and predictive power. This stepwise approach ensured I could interpret the role of each variable, as well as its interactions with both dependent and independent variables. In the original analysis, I also included visualizations—mapping evacuation behavior and plotting interactions to explore how social capital dimensions shape outcomes. The project was first conducted in R and later recoded in Python. Due to the sensitive nature of the underlying data (location information from Facebook users), the dataset itself is not shared here.
